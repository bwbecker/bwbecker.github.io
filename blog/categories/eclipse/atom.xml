    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Eclipse for my Play! + Scala development, but frustration reached the tipping point and I decided to give <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/">IDEA</a> a try.  It had been highly recommended by fellow developers at a Scala Meetup (now defunct, sadly).  The conversion process has been painful, with some hard-won lessons to report.</p>

<p>So, what drove me around the bend with Eclipse?  One more bout with it reporting
many false positive compilation errors with no easy way to reset things that I could find.  SBT would give a completely clean compile;  Eclipse would report dozens of errors spread over many, many files.  That, and I can be a sucker for new toys.</p>

<h2>IDEA Installation</h2>

<p>These comments are based on IDEA version 14.1.3 and the Scala plugin 1.5.1.</p>

<p>The IDEA installation was painful.  Here&rsquo;s what I learned:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Out of date documentation</strong>:  There is <em>a lot</em> of documentation on the IDEA web site; much of it woefully
out of date.  For example, a Google search for &ldquo;intellij idea scala play&rdquo; landed me at a
features page touting <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/features/scala.html">IDEA 13</a>
with links to a
<a href="https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/IntelliJIDEA/Scala">tutorial</a> posted
in 2013.  As the comments at the bottom of the page atest, it&rsquo;s not applicable.</p>

<p>If I had landed at this <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/features/play_framework.html">features overview</a> instead, things would have been somewhat
less rocky.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Ultimate Edition required</strong>:  Working with Play! requires the Ultimate Edition.  This
tidbit is well hidden.  This <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/features/play_framework.html">Play! plugin page</a>,
for example, touts support for templates, routes files, etc.  No where does it mention that the
Community Edition won&rsquo;t work and the download button at the bottom offers both versions, implying
that either will work.  The linked
<a href="https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/IntelliJIDEA/Play+Framework+2.0">tutorial</a> doesn&rsquo;t mention it either.</p>

<p>It <em>is</em> found on the <a href="http://blog.jetbrains.com/scala/2014/09/17/scala-and-play-2-0-plugin-for-intellij-idea-14-eap-is-out/">Scala plugin blog</a>.  It&rsquo;s the last sentence of a paragraph that you need to scroll to see.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Run Play2 App</strong> may or may not appear in the context menu, as the documentation
on the <a href="https://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.4.x/IDE">Play! website</a> and the
<a href="https://confluence.jetbrains.com/download/attachments/49455798/PlayRunningApp.png?version=1&amp;modificationDate=1397129336000">IntelliJ tutorial</a>
indicate.  I needed to create a run configuration on my own, first:</p>

<ol>
<li>Go to &ldquo;Run &ndash;> Edit Configurations&hellip;&rdquo;</li>
<li>Hit the &ldquo;+&rdquo; sign and choose &ldquo;Play2 App&rdquo; from the drop-down.</li>
<li>Give it a name and accept the defaults.</li>
</ol>


<p>I still don&rsquo;t find it in the context menu, but it does appear in the Run
menu.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>In retrospect, these are little things.  At the time, however, they were confusing and
chewed up time I could have better spent elsewhere.</p>

<h2>Experience</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m still getting used to IDEA, but here are some initial observations:</p>

<ol>
<li>IDEA has a number of code-smell filters (&ldquo;inspections&rdquo;).  Some of them led to code
improvements.  I wish the hover that describes the problem wasn&rsquo;t so sensitive.  It
disappears quite easily.</li>
<li>There are some false positive type errors &ndash; the same thing that drove me around the
bend with Eclipse.  So far they are isolated cases rather than the whole system
going bonkers as sometimes happened in Eclipse.</li>
<li>I like nested helper functions.  The Eclipse Outline view shows them;  IDEA&rsquo;s
Structure view (the closest equivalent) does not.</li>
<li>IDEA detects as soon as I use something that hasn&rsquo;t been imported.  So far it&rsquo;s made
good guesses when it offers to automatically add the import.</li>
<li>It seems snappier for editing, but slower than SBT for compiling.</li>
</ol>
